We developed a version of the Flappy Bird game using Java and the NetBeans IDE. We implemented the main spheres of the game using the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and utilized Java graphic components such as JPanel and JFrame to create the Graphic User Interface.

To run the project it is possible to export the project as a zip file to an IDE, e.g NetBeans and Eclipse, or simple execute the jar file. For that matter, it is required to have installed Java in your workspace. You may find more about it in [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2b-integrator/5.2?topic=installation-setting-java-variables-in-windows).
